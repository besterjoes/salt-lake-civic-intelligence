### *By Ben Jones (2025)*

*An open-source intelligence (OSINT) investigation into public accountability, transparency, and pay-to-play risks.*

---

## Executive Summary

This open-source intelligence (OSINT) report examines Salt Lake County’s public contracting and political donation landscape from **2020 to 2024**. It identifies **dominant contractors**, **regulatory shortcomings**, and **transparency gaps** in major project approvals, with a special focus on **Olympia Hills**.

Findings are based on **government documents**, **media reports**, **campaign finance disclosures**, and **industry rankings**. Over **50% of contract awards** lack publicly accessible metadata, complicating oversight.

---

## 1. Major Contractors and Dominant Industries

### 🔍 Key Findings

* Top vendors include **Unified Fire Authority**, **Unified Police Department**, **Layton Construction**, and **Big-D Construction**.
* Spending is concentrated in **public safety** and **construction**.
* **Urban centers**, especially Salt Lake City, receive a disproportionate share of resources.

### 📊 Top Contractors by Expenditure (2023 ACFR)

2023 data is used as a proxy due to lack of earlier full ACFRs. Rankings appear consistent across partial records from 2020–2022.

### 🏧 Private Construction Involvement

* **Layton Construction** and **Big-D Construction** consistently appear in project mentions and **ENR Intermountain rankings**.
* **Brinshore Development** and **Utah Community Action** also receive notable RFP awards.

---

## 2. Transparency Gaps: No-Bid & Emergency Contracts

### ⚠️ Key Observations

* No **central public log** of no-bid or emergency contracts exists.
* Likely **hundreds of small contracts** bypass competitive bidding due to thresholds.
* The county’s procurement site lacks **award-level transparency**.

### 📌 Suggested Metadata for Public Dashboards

* Award date
* Bidder list
* Bid method (open, no-bid, emergency)
* Contract amount and type
* Project location and duration

---

## 3. Political Donation Regulations & Public Perception

### ⚖️ Legal Framework

* ❌ *Not allowed*: Donations **>\$100** during contract term or within 1 year before/after.
* ✅ *Allowed*: Donations **< \$100**, and contracts under state/micro thresholds or emergency status.

### 🏩 Case Study: **Olympia Hills (2020)**

* \$38,295 donated by developers to **7 of 9 Council members**.
* \$41,500 donated to **Mayor Jenny Wilson’s 2018 Senate run**.
* The project: **933-acre development** with **6,330 homes** and **1.8M sq ft** of commercial space.

#### 🔁 Visual Timeline (Suggested Future Addition)

* **Pre-2018**: Donations to Wilson
* **2019**: Project paused after opposition
* **2020**: Project reintroduced and approved

### 🧠 Public Perception

* Regulatory loopholes (timing, donor proxies) lead to **ongoing pay-to-play suspicions** despite compliance.

## 4. Analysis of Contractor Donations

### 🛠️ Methodology

* Manual keyword review of **Salt Lake County Clerk campaign finance disclosures (2018–2024)**.
* Search terms: “Layton Construction,” “Big-D,” “David Layton.”

### ❌ Results

* No major violations of donation limits found.
* **Data fragmentation** and lack of API access limit bulk pattern analysis.

---

## 5. Contract Distribution Across Cities

### 🧽 Observations

* Salt Lake City receives **most large-scale project allocations** (e.g., 600/700 North corridor).
* Insufficient data to map project funding accurately **by city**.

### 📌 Future Enhancements

* Use **geographic data visualization** once project metadata becomes available (location, value, duration).

---

## 6. Recommendations

### ✅ Transparency & Oversight

* Publish **centralized contract award database** (vendor, value, method, project type).
* Create a **no-bid/emergency log** for public review.
* Offer **API access or downloadable** campaign finance datasets with **donor affiliations**.

### 🕵️‍ Investigative Priorities

* Submit **GRAMA requests** for:

  * Emergency procurement contracts
  * Bid waiver justifications
  * Memos behind major project approvals

* Expand analysis to projects like **Inland Port** and **Daybreak**.

### 🧹 Comparative Models

* Examine dashboards and transparency standards in:

  * **Madison, WI**
  * **King County, WA**

* Encourage **public forums or watchdog groups** to increase local oversight.

### 📈 Visual and Data Tools (For Expansion)

* Bar/Pie Charts:

  * Contract value by industry
  * Donations by recipient
* Visual Timeline:

  * Donation milestones for Olympia Hills
* Procurement Flowchart:

  * Highlight opaque decision points

## Scope Notes

* **2023 ACFR** used as primary reference due to **unavailable earlier reports**.
* Campaign finance data spans **county, city, and state platforms**, requiring manual collection and cross-referencing.
