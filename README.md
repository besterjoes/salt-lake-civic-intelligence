Public Contracting and Political Donations in Salt Lake County (2020–2024): An OSINT Report
Author: Ben Jones
Date: 2025
Purpose: An Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) analysis of public accountability, transparency, and potential pay-to-play activities in Salt Lake County.

Executive Summary
This OSINT report examines Salt Lake County's public contracting and political donations from 2020 to 2024. The analysis identifies major contractors, assesses regulatory effectiveness, scrutinizes high-profile developments (Olympia Hills), and explores significant transparency gaps. Data sources include government documents, media investigations, campaign finance disclosures, and industry rankings.

Transparency Issue: Over 50% of awarded contracts lack publicly available metadata.

1. Major Contractors and Dominant Industries
Key Findings:
Top Contractors: Unified Fire Authority, Unified Police Department, Layton Construction, Big-D Construction.

Dominant Sectors: Public Safety and Construction.

Unequal Distribution: Urban centers disproportionately receive county-funded projects.

Top Contractors (2023 ACFR):
Data from 2023 serves as representative due to availability constraints.

Rankings reflect consistent trends observed from partial 2020–2022 data.

Notable Private Firms:
Layton Construction, Big-D Construction (verified via ENR Intermountain rankings and county documentation).

Other significant entities include Brinshore Development and Utah Community Action.

2. Transparency Gaps: No-Bid & Emergency Contracts
Observations:
No comprehensive public records for no-bid or emergency contracts.

Hundreds of contracts potentially bypass competitive bidding.

Suggested Public Metadata:
Award date

Bidder list

Bid method (open/no-bid/emergency)

Contract amount and type

Project location and duration

3. Political Donation Regulations & Public Perception
Regulatory Framework:
Prohibited Activities	Allowed Activities
Donations over $100 during contract periods or elections.	Donations below $100.
Contracts within 1 year post-major donation (> $100).	Small/emergency purchases, statewide contracts.

Olympia Hills Case Study (2020):
Total Donations:

$38,295 to 7/9 Council members

$41,500 to Mayor Jenny Wilson's 2018 Senate campaign

Project Details:

933 acres, 6,330 homes, 1.8M sq. ft. commercial space.

Suggested Timeline (for Future Implementation):
Pre-2018: Initial donations

2019: Project introduced and paused

2020: Approval after reconsideration

Public Perception:
Persistent pay-to-play suspicions due to regulatory loopholes and indirect donation channels.

4. Analysis of Contractor Donations
Methodology:
Manual review of County Clerk disclosures (2018–2024).

Keywords: "Layton Construction," "Big-D," "David Layton."

Results:
No major violations identified.

Fragmented and inaccessible data hampers comprehensive analysis.

5. Contract Distribution Across Cities
Observations:
Disproportionate allocation to Salt Lake City (e.g., infrastructure projects at 600/700 North).

Detailed geographical analysis currently limited due to incomplete metadata.

Recommendations for Improvement:
Geographic visualization of contracts upon metadata availability.

6. Recommendations
Transparency & Oversight Improvements:
Centralized contract award database (vendor, value, method, project details).

Publicly accessible log of no-bid and emergency contracts.

API or downloadable campaign finance data including donor affiliations.

Investigative Priorities:
Submit GRAMA requests for emergency contracts, bid waivers, and project selection documents.

Expand investigations to additional high-profile projects.

Comparative Models:
Review transparency practices in Madison, WI and King County, WA.

Foster community oversight through public forums and watchdog groups.

Visual/Data Enhancements:
Charts: Contract distribution by sector; donation flows.

Timelines: Highlight major donation milestones (Olympia Hills).

Flowcharts: Procurement process and decision points.

Scope Notes
Data Limitations: Earlier ACFRs (2020–2022) incomplete; 2023 data representative.

Campaign finance information fragmented, requiring manual compilation.
