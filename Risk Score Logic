Weâ€™ve implemented a risk score system to automatically identify high-risk contracts in the procurement dataset. 
The scoring is based on weighted factors drawn from audit findings, transparency guidelines, and procurement oversight criteria.

Scoring Logic Summary
Each contract is evaluated based on two types of indicators:

Core Risk Factors
Factor	Criteria	Score
Sole-Source / No Bids	Bids == 0	+3
Large Contract Without Justification	Contract Value > $100K and no justification memo	+2
Repeated Vendor Awards	Same vendor, same agency, Award Count >= 3 in 2 years	+2
Exemption / Emergency / Piggyback	Procurement Type includes exemption, emergency, piggyback	+2
Vague / Generic Scope	Description includes vague terms (e.g., "services", "misc.")	+2
Amendment After Award	Amendment exceeds 25% of original contract value	+2
Just Below Approval Threshold	Total just under oversight cap (e.g., $49,999)	+1

Supporting Indicators
Factor	Criteria	Score
Missing Bid Documentation	No RFP or public bidding documents available	+1
Audit Findings	Vendor or agency flagged in audit reports	+1
Political Ties	Vendor made recent political donations	+2
Vendor Dominance	Vendor received more than 50% of agency spend	+2
