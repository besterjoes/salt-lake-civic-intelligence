# High-Risk Contract Scoring System

This document outlines the logic used to assign a `risk_score` to each contract in the procurement dataset. The scoring framework is based on red flags commonly identified in government audits, transparency watchdogs, and public procurement oversight.

The goal is to prioritize contracts for further review by assigning points to characteristics that suggest elevated risk of fraud, favoritism, waste, or lack of oversight.

## Scoring Logic Summary

Each contract is evaluated based on two types of criteria: **Core Risk Factors** and **Supporting Indicators**. These are weighted to reflect the severity of potential risk.
